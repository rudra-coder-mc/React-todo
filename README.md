# React Todo App

## Description

This project is a Todo application built using React on the frontend and Express.js with Node.js on the backend. It utilizes Redux Toolkit for state management on the frontend and MongoDB with Mongoose for the database. Tailwind CSS is used for styling the frontend components.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to manage their todo lists.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete todo items.
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes made by one user are instantly reflected for all users viewing the same todo list.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly styling applications.
  - Redux Toolkit: An opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
- **Backend**:
  - Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
  - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL database program, using JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
  - Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
